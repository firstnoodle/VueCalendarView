# CalendarView

A small CodeSandbox project (using its beta git integration) to built a calendar from "scratch" (using `vue` and `moment`).
It is mainly meant to be used as a `popper` together with a text-input, to create a DatePicker - but could be used alone as well.

It consist of a `DateView`, `MonthView` and `YearView` for easily navigating to the desired date - and arrowKeys (or other navigational interfaces..) can be used to move around, via the `moveRequest` method.
